# Bidirectional-Non-Inverting-Buck-Boost

The converter has the ability to work in buck and boost mode. Since the converter is bi-directional, no extra circuitry is required to charge the battery.

Specification of the converter:
1. Efficiency: 96.34%
2. Total Capacitance: 94uF
3. Total core weight of all the Inductors: 4.83g
4. Output Ripple: +- 0.3V
